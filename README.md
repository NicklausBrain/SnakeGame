# SnakeGame
Snake Game. Pure JS. OO paradigm. No Frameworks.
(Educational application to demonstrate vanilla JS capabilities.)

At the moment has only two 3rd-party dependencies:
- Reqire JS (to nicely split the APP into modules) https://requirejs.org/
- Font Awesome (for cool icons), expected to be replaced with the hand-made SVGs
# How to run
- Directly through GitHub: https://nicklausbrain.github.io/SnakeGame/SnakeGame
- Host using any HTTP server
- Can be hosted by Node.JS out of the box, running:
``` bash
npm install
npm start
```
- Presumably can be launched by firefox directly from the file system
